Error description

    When running a DataStage job which was reset after its
    previous run, this fault can cause incorrect status and
    row count information to be shown on the Director job
    monitor screen. It also affects the link information
    delivered from the dsjob command and the DataStage APIs.

Local fix

    Workaround: Recompile the job instead of resetting it

Permanent Fix : Install the JR62493 patch on the engine tier.
